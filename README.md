## Introduction 

Using Monero + Qubes OS (running Whonix) you can have a Monero wallet that is without networking and running on a virtually isolated system from the Monero daemon which has all of its traffic forced over Tor.

## Things to Know About Qubes OS

Qubes OS requires a dedicated machine. Qubes OS is not a Linux distro. It is a specialized operating system that runs on hypervisor technology, allowing you to run Linux distros on a virtual machine within the Qubes OS.
If you do not already have a Qubes machine, you will want to consult the Qubes OS [Hardware Compatibility List](https://www.qubes-os.org/hcl/). You may find a device on this list you already own, or it may help you shop around for one that will work. Tip: plan to max out the capable RAM capacity for max performance.
